# AgriCraft Plant JSON

AgriCraft 2.0.0 introduces an exciting new feature: **JSON Custom Plants**!

JSON Custom Plants (i.e. AgriPlants) allow for total control of your agricultural experience, 
and even work in multiplayer environments!

This page will serve as a guide to using this awesome new feature of AgriCraft!

## Note

The JSON file may be located in any folder under the `config\agricraft\json\default` directory.
Furthermore, the file must end in with `_plant.json` so that for a plant like wheat, the file name would be `wheat_plant.json`.
This requirement is made so that the JSON file loader can differentiate between the different JSON file types.

## Structure

This is the structure for Agricraft 3.0.0

## Render types

- **Hashtag** (#) : 4 faces parallel with the block faces, similar to Vanilla wheat.
- **Cross**   (x) : 2 faces along the diagonals, similar to Vanilla flowers.
- **Plus**    (+) : Similar to cross, but instead 4 crosses at each crop stick.
- **Gourd**   (@) : i.e. for pumpkins and melons: renders a hash pattern for the initial stages, with a small gourd for the final stage.
- **Rhombus** (◇) : 4 faces spanning between the centers of the block faces, only used for weeds.

## About Mystical Agriculture

Mystical Agriculture and its addon have non-usual plants. Their plants/seeds are dynamically colored.
We thus introduced a new render type **mysticalagriculture** which render the plant like the **plus** render type.
This render type expects the last texture in the textures array to contain two textures: one for the stem, and another for the flowers:
```json
[
	"mysticalagriculture:block/mystical_resource_crop_7",
	"mysticalagriculture:block/flower_ingot"
]
```
