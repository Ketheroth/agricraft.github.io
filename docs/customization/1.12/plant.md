# AgriCraft Plant JSON


AgriCraft 2.0.0 introduces an exciting new feature: **JSON Custom Plants**!

JSON Custom Plants (i.e. AgriPlants) allow for total control of your agricultural experience,
and even work in multiplayer environments!

This page will serve as a guide to using this awesome new feature of AgriCraft!

## Note

The JSON file may be located in any folder under the `config\agricraft\json\default` directory.
Furthermore, the file must end in with `_plant.json` so that for a plant like wheat, the file name would be `wheat_plant.json`.
This requirement is made so that the JSON file loader can differentiate between the different JSON file types.

## Structure

```json5
{
  "enabled": true, // Determines if the plant should be loaded or not.
  "path": "", // An internal field used for the transmission of JSON definitions.
  "id": "", // The unique string id for the plant.
  "plant_name": "", // The name of the plant. This does not need to be unique.
  "seed_name": "", // The name of the auto-generated seed for the plant. This will not be used if a valid seed item is defined.
  "seed_items": [ // An array containing the seed items that map to this plant.

  "bonemeal": true, // Determines if the plant accepts fertilizer to accelerate its growth.
  "tier": 1, // The tier of the plant. A legacy value.
  "weedable": false, // Determines if the plant acts like a weed and cannot be harvested normally.
  "aggressive": false, // Determines if the plant should try to overtake neighboring crops.
  "spread_chance": 0.1, // Determines the chance the plant has of attempting to move to a neighboring crop [range: 0.0-1.0].
  "spawn_chance": 0.0, // Determines the chance the plant has of randomly spawning in an unoccupied crop [range: 0.0-1.0].
  "products": {
    "products": [ // A list containing the possible products of the plant.

    "soils": [], // Array containing string ids for AgriSoils that are considered valid for this plant.
    "conditions": [ // Array containing all the growth requirement conditions to be met.
      {
        "amount": 1,  // The amount required in the given range.
        "min_x": 0,   // The bounding box, relative to the crop at 0, 0, 0 in which the block(s) are to be placed.
        "min_y": -2,  // In this case we specify the box {(0, -2, 0), (0, -2, 0)}, which is the single block directly
        "min_z": 0,   // below the soil block. Notice that the upper bound is inclusive, so that to specify a
        "max_x": 0,   // single block we use the same point twice, not the upper left and lower right points.
        "max_y": -2,
        "max_z": 0,
        "item": "minecraft:gold_ore", // This part specifies information about the block required.
        "meta": 0, // This is a *direct* extension of an AgriStack meaning that it has all the same fields as
        "tags": "", // would be found on say the seed_items field.

        "ignoreTags": [],
        "useOreDict": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "texture": {
    "render_type": "", // Can be either "cross", "hash", or "stem". This determines the method used to render the plant.
    "seed_texture": "", // A string representing the seed texture. This is used for the autogenerated seed items.
    "plant_textures": [] // An array of strings representing the plant textures.
